# dropboxignore — post-v0.2 polish follow-ups

Items surfaced during PR #11's end-of-branch review (negation-semantics, item 10) and adjacent v0.2-maturation PRs. All are polish-scope — none block the features as shipped — but worth tracking so they don't accumulate into systemic drift.

Carry into a v0.3 polish PR or address as standalone small PRs whenever the file in question is next touched.

## 1. Stale `# Task 3` banner in `tests/test_rules_conflicts.py`

Left over from the task-by-task execution of the implementation plan. The other tests in the file don't carry similar banners — it reads as an orphan comment now that the feature is integrated. Delete the comment line.

Touches: `tests/test_rules_conflicts.py:51` (one-line removal).

## 2. Redundant inline imports in new test functions

`tests/test_cli_status_list_explain.py` has several new test functions with in-body imports like `from dropboxignore import cli, state` even though those modules are already imported at the top of the file. Copied verbatim from the implementation plan's self-contained snippets; works but adds visual noise.

Fix: consolidate to module-level imports; remove the duplicates. Same cleanup applies to `tests/test_rules_reload_explain.py` where a handful of tests have `from dropboxignore.rules import RuleCache` inside the function body.

Touches: `tests/test_cli_status_list_explain.py`, `tests/test_rules_reload_explain.py`.

## 3. `_SequenceEntry.pattern: object` could be a `Protocol`

The field is typed `object` with a comment noting "duck-typed (.include, .match_file)". This is intentionally loose so that `_FakePattern` in the unit tests can satisfy the type. A `typing.Protocol` with the two expected attributes would be equally permissive and give static type checkers something to verify callers against.

Proposed:

```python
class _PatternLike(Protocol):
    include: bool | None
    def match_file(self, path: str) -> object: ...

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class _SequenceEntry:
    ...
    pattern: _PatternLike
```

Touches: `src/dropboxignore/rules.py` near `_SequenceEntry`; likely a Protocol declaration next to the existing imports.

## 4. `dropboxignore status` output doesn't column-align conflicts

The conflicts section uses fixed two-space separators between fields. At 5+ conflicts with varying pattern lengths, the columns slide based on content, reducing scannability. For example:

```
rule conflicts (2):
  .dropboxignore:2  !build/keep/  masked by .dropboxignore:1  build/
  .dropboxignore:5  !node_modules/some-very-long-package/  masked by .dropboxignore:1  node_modules/
```

Fix: compute column widths first, pad with `f"{s:<width}"`. Cheap (adds ~5 lines) but requires a test update because string comparisons in existing tests would need to tolerate padding. Not worth doing without a concrete user report.

Touches: `src/dropboxignore/cli.py` `status` conflicts block; `tests/test_cli_status_list_explain.py` relaxes substring assertions.

## 5. `_ancestors_of` calls `Path.resolve()` on every rule mutation

CLAUDE.md's Gotchas section flags `Path.resolve()` as a Windows perf hazard (per-call syscall). `_detect_conflicts` invokes `_ancestors_of` once per negation rule, each call doing one `.resolve()`. The cost fires only during rule mutations (rare — `load_root` on daemon start, `reload_file` on watchdog events, manual CLI invocations), and resolves exactly one path per negation. Negligible in practice.

The note here is about documentation, not optimization: add a comment in `_ancestors_of` explaining that the `.resolve()` cost is bounded to mutation events so a future reader doesn't "optimize" it out for the wrong reason (and break the path-equality invariant that downstream `is_relative_to` checks depend on).

Touches: `src/dropboxignore/rules.py` `_ancestors_of` docstring.

## 6. `rules.py` has grown to ~530 lines; detection layer could extract

The detection layer (`literal_prefix`, `_ancestors_of`, `_find_masking_include`, `_detect_conflicts`, `Conflict`) is ~120 lines and has no coupling to `RuleCache` internals beyond the input-sequence shape. It could live in `rules_conflicts.py` or `conflicts.py` alongside `rules.py`; `RuleCache._recompute_conflicts` would import and call.

Not pressing — the file is still single-responsibility at a stretch, and splitting costs a sibling file plus one import edit. Worth revisiting in v0.3 if any further detection logic lands (e.g., cross-root conflicts, conflicts across installs) or if another feature pushes `rules.py` past ~650 lines.

Touches: `src/dropboxignore/rules.py` → `src/dropboxignore/rules_conflicts.py` (new); one import.

## 7. No test for the "sandwich" ordering `include → negation → another_include`

By inspection of `_detect_conflicts`, the algorithm only looks at `sequence[:i]` (entries before the current negation), so a later include can't retroactively affect an earlier negation's conflict state. The `include → !negation → another_include` shape therefore works correctly — the `another_include` is invisible to the detector.

But there's no explicit test pinning this. If a future refactor accidentally changed the slice to `sequence[i + 1:]` or iterated the full sequence, the bug would only surface in real-world `.dropboxignore` files, not in the test suite.

Fix: a three-entry test in `tests/test_rules_conflicts.py` with `build/` + `!build/keep/` + `src/`, asserting exactly one conflict and that the presence of `src/` didn't change detection.

Touches: `tests/test_rules_conflicts.py` (one new test).

## 8. Pre-flight should run commit-check against every branch commit, not just HEAD

The task-15 pre-flight pattern used in recent PRs runs `commit-check --message` against the planned PR title or HEAD subject only. CI (`commit-check-action@v2.6.0`) runs the check against **every commit in the PR** — i.e. the full `origin/main..HEAD` range.

Surfaced by PR #12: one intermediate commit (`docs: --purge scope broadened (...)`) passed my local HEAD check (which ran against a different planned subject) but failed CI because its description starts with `--`, which commit-check's Conventional Commits regex treats as ambiguous with flag syntax. The force-push round-trip to amend was avoidable.

**Proposed fix:** add a pre-flight snippet to the CLAUDE.md Git workflow section that matches what CI runs:

```bash
git log --pretty=format:'%s%n' origin/main..HEAD | while IFS= read -r msg; do
  [ -z "$msg" ] && continue
  printf '%s\n' "$msg" > /tmp/m.txt
  commit-check --message --no-banner --compact /tmp/m.txt || echo "FAIL: $msg"
done
```

Local green becomes CI green on the message check. Prevents recurrence of the PR #12 force-push round-trip.

Touches: `CLAUDE.md` (Git workflow section, new bullet or extended existing one).

## 9. Release workflow should have a `workflow_dispatch` trigger

`.github/workflows/release.yml` triggers only on `push: tags: ['v*']`. That meant the workflow's first real exercise was the v0.2.0 release itself — where it failed at the PyInstaller step (pyinstaller wasn't installed; see PR #14 for the fix). The bug had been latent for the entire lifetime of the workflow; no PR before v0.2.0 exercised it.

Adding a second trigger lets us dry-run the release build without creating a tag:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    tags: ['v*']
  workflow_dispatch:
```

With `workflow_dispatch`, the workflow becomes runnable via `gh workflow run release.yml` or the GitHub UI. Two tweaks needed in the body: the `Publish GitHub Release` step should probably gate on `if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')` so manual runs don't attempt to publish a Release from a non-tag ref; the workflow can still build and upload artifacts as step outputs / run artifacts for verification.

Next time a release-workflow change lands, we can dispatch-run it manually before tagging. Prevents the "first exercise is the actual release" failure mode.

Touches: `.github/workflows/release.yml`.

## 10. Publish releases as the repo owner, not `github-actions[bot]`

v0.2.0 was published by `github-actions[bot]` because `softprops/action-gh-release` authenticates via the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`. Visible in `gh release view v0.2.0` → `author: github-actions[bot]`. The release is still authoritative and tied to the repo's audit trail, but the UI-facing attribution reads as machine-authored rather than owner-authored.

Two mechanisms to fix:

- **Personal access token (PAT)** with `contents: write` + `actions: write` scopes. Store as a repo secret (`GH_RELEASE_TOKEN` or similar); pass to the action via `token: ${{ secrets.GH_RELEASE_TOKEN }}`. Simplest. Cost: secret management + periodic rotation.
- **GitHub App** with identity. More complex setup; justified if the token needs organization-wide reach or the PAT's personal scope would be too broad.

PAT is the standard solo-dev choice. Requires a one-time setup (generate PAT → add secret → update workflow), then releases surface under your GitHub identity.

Touches: `.github/workflows/release.yml` (add `token:` input to the `softprops/action-gh-release` step); repo secrets (one-time, outside of the repo tree).

## 11. Publish releases to PyPI from the release workflow

`dropboxignore` isn't on PyPI today. Users install via `uv tool install git+https://github.com/kiloscheffer/dropboxignore` (source build from git) or by downloading the wheel from GitHub Releases manually. `pip install dropboxignore` doesn't work. Discoverability penalty: PyPI search + `pip`-based pipelines skip this project entirely.

Fix: add a step to `release.yml` that uploads `dist/*.whl` + `dist/*.tar.gz` to PyPI after the GitHub Release is published. Two auth mechanisms:

- **Trusted Publishing via OIDC** (GitHub's recommended approach since 2023). No secrets; PyPI verifies the workflow's GitHub identity via OIDC token. One-time setup: register the repo as a Trusted Publisher on PyPI (account admin page). Workflow uses `pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1` with no credentials; the action extracts the OIDC token automatically.
- **API token** stored as a PyPI secret. Older pattern; works but requires token rotation.

Trusted Publishing is the cleaner choice — no secrets to leak or rotate. One-time PyPI registration, then all future releases publish automatically on tag push.

There's also a question of whether to claim the name `dropboxignore` on PyPI even if we don't publish yet (name squatting is frowned upon but reservation for a project about to publish is legitimate). Register-and-publish-v0.2.0 is the clean path; name reservation without a release is worth skipping.

Touches: `.github/workflows/release.yml` (add PyPI upload step); PyPI account (one-time — register project as Trusted Publisher).
